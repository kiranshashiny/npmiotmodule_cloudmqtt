# npmiotmodule_cloudmqtt

Work in Progress !!! - Not complete

Module which publishes and subscribes to events from the Cloudmqtt broker.

The node js code prints the received events on the xterm as it arrives.



Prerequisites on the Broker : 

    An account on cloudmqtt.com ( Mine is KoolCat )

    Open the CloudMQTT console, and get the instance info like the server name,
    
    Port to connect to, username and the password. You will need this to feed into the nodejs code
    
    in order to subscribe to events to/from the Cloud broker/
